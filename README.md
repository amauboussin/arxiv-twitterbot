### Brundage Bot

Brundage Bot is a twitter bot trained powered by a convolutional neural trained on [Mile Brundage's curated arXiv tweets](https://twitter.com/Miles_Brundage).
 


See the results on Twitter here: [twitter.com/arxiv_papers](https://twitter.com/arxiv_papers).



###### A few notes

* The favorite and RT columns in miles_links.csv reflect the time when I downloaded each Tweet and are not up to date.
* The Conv Net uses a different feature representation than the logistic regression model because I adapted it from one of my other projects.
