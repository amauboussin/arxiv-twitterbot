###### A few notes

* The favorite and RT columns in miles_links.csv reflect the time when I downloaded each Tweet and are not up to date.
* The Conv Net uses a different feature representation than the logistic regression model because I adapted it from one of my other projects and didn't bother to change the code, not for any technical reason.
